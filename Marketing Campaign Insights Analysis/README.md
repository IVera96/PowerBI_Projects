# Marketing Campaign Insights Analysis 

Project Idea: Build a Power BI dashboard to analyze marketing campaign success and customer engagement across demographic segments and sales channels. Start by importing campaign and customer transaction data into Power BI and cleaning it using Power Query. Use data transformations to categorize attributes like marital status, education, age, income, and campaign responses. Create a clustered bar chart to show the sum of income segmented by marital status and education, and use a horizontal bar chart to display product preferences across different marital groups. Implement a bar chart comparing campaign cost vs. revenue to evaluate ROI. Use column charts to explore age vs. expenditure trends, helping identify high-value age groups. Add pie charts for product sales distribution, purchase channels (e.g., online vs. store), and campaign acceptance rates to summarize categorical insights visually. Leverage bubble charts to analyze customer-wise spending patterns and surface high-value individuals. Apply heatmaps to review campaign performance across platforms or regions. Utilize Power BI DAX measures to calculate conversion rates, CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), and ROI. Incorporate Smart Narrative to auto-generate dynamic summaries of campaign insights, and Cards to display KPIs at a glance. Enable interactive filtering using slicers ,by age group, education, campaign name, and platform to allow stakeholders to drill down into specific campaign segments and uncover hidden trends. This project is ideal for beginners and provides hands-on experience with Power BI while offering actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies.
